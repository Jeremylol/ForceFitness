1.	Start off by placing a resistance band mid-waist high either around a post or an exercise machine.
2.	Stand in front of the machine or post, keeping your feet together, abs tight and knees slightly bent so that you feel a tension in the band.
3.	Slowly and in a controlled manner, bring your arms back until they are parallel with your sides.
4.	Once you reach the final position, hold for a count while squeezing your back muscles, then return back to the starting position.
