1.	Stand in front of a medium-height rotating pulley and grab each side of the rope attachment. Step back away from the machine until your arms are fully extended in front of you. Your feet should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart and with a soft bend in your knees.
2.	Brace core and drive elbows past back, while pulling the rope handles slightly outside of your ears. Hold and contract shoulder blades together.
