1.	Start with a standard forward lunge. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, then take a big step forward and lower until both knees are bent at a 90Â° angle. Make sure your torso is kept upright and as straight as possible throughout.
2.	From this position, summon the energy to push explosively off the ground, switching the positions of your legs while airborne so that you land and can immediately drop into another lunge but with the opposite leg forwards. Make sure you land as softly as possible.
