Position yourself on the dip/raise machine, back against the pad and arms holding your body up by resting on the parallel bars. There should be hand grips to hold onto at the ends of the parallel bars, and there are usually foot bars to step up on to get into position.
Allow your legs to dangle and then slowly lift your knees toward your chest. The motion should be controlled and deliberate as you bring your knees up until your thighs are parallel to the floor.
Return your legs to the starting position, letting them down slowly.
