1.	Hold a weight in one hand, hanging to the side. Stand on one leg, on the same side that you hold the kettlebell.
2.	Keeping that knee slightly bent, perform a stiff-legged deadlift by bending at the hip, extending your free leg behind you for balance. Continue lowering the weight until you are parallel to the ground, and then return to the upright position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
