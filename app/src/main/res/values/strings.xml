\n\n<b>Before You Start: Safety Precautions:</b>
\n\tIf you are planning to increase your physical activity or start an exercise program, you start with a sedentary activityâ€”answering a few short questions, that is. The PAR-Q (Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire) is the gold standard in fitness safety, used by doctors, trainers and health clubs the world over. Usually comprised of 5-7 questions, it can help rule out any underlying health concerns that could worsen with exercise. Answer yes or no to the following questions.
\n\n<b>1.</b> Has your doctor ever said that you have a heart condition and that you should only do physical activity recommended by a doctor?
\n\n<b>2.</b> Do you feel pain in your chest when you do physical activity?
\n\n<b>3.</b> In the past month, have you had chest pain when you were not doing physical activity?
\n\n<b>4.</b> Do you lose your balance because of dizziness or do you ever lose consciousness?
\n\n<b>5.</b> Do you have a bone or joint problem (for example, back, knee, or hip) that could be made worse by a change in your physical activity?
\n\n<b>6.</b> Is your doctor currently prescribing drugs (for example, water pills) for your blood pressure or heart condition?
\n\n<b>7.</b> Do you know of any other reason why you should not do physical activity?
\n\n<b>If you answer YES to any of the questions on this list, consider checking in with your doctor
        and get cleared for exercise before you start.</b>
